in this we have used rslim087a's data

now we will take the data and clean it as per out condictions and them make a model

I have architectured the model over reserch paper 'End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars' of NVIDIA, few parameters have been tweaked as per my memory capacity

then we test it in UDACITY SIM

here only angle have been ai generated, throttel is continous
